Phase 2.7  Design Feasibility Check
ERROR:Place:1136 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <My_DCM/clkout2_buf>, driving the net, <r_clk_spi>, that is driving the
   following (first 30) non-clock load pins.
   < PIN: Inst_spi_sleva/r_clock_1.D1; >
   < PIN: Inst_spi_sleva/r_clock.D; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. If you wish to override this recommendation, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint (given below) in the .ucf file to demote
   this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue.
